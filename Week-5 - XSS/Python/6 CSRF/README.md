Steps to Perform the CSRF Attack:

Run the Vulnerable App:
        Start the vulnerable app on port 5000:

    python vulnerable_app.py

Login to the Vulnerable App:

    Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and log in using:

        Username: admin
        Password: pass

Simulate the CSRF Attack:
        Open the attacker's form (hosted on a different domain) or save the HTML file (attacker.html) locally and open it in your browser.
        The attacker form will simulate the transfer of $1000 when the victim (logged into the vulnerable app) clicks the button.

Effect of the Attack:
        The malicious form will submit a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/transfer, transferring $1000 without the userâ€™s explicit consent.
        The victim remains unaware that their session was used to perform the unauthorized action.

CSRF Attack Demonstration:

When the victim (logged in to the vulnerable app) clicks the "Click Here to Claim Your Prize!" button, the following steps occur:

The attacker form submits a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/transfer with a hidden amount of $1000.
Since the victim is logged in and their session is active, the vulnerable app processes the request as if it was a legitimate request from the user.
The funds are transferred without the victim's knowledge, demonstrating a successful Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
Explanation of Security Headers:

#Content Security Policy (CSP):
        The policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'" ensures that all resources, including scripts, can only be loaded from the current domain (self), which prevents the loading of external scripts.
        This helps prevent XSS attacks by disallowing the execution of malicious scripts from other domains.

X-Content-Type-Options:
The X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header prevents browsers from trying to guess the MIME type, which can lead to vulnerabilities.
This stops the browser from interpreting files as something other than what they are.

X-Frame-Options:
The X-Frame-Options: DENY header prevents the page from being loaded in a frame or iframe, protecting against clickjacking attacks.

X-XSS-Protection:
The X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block header enables basic cross-site scripting protection for older browsers. If an XSS attack is detected, the browser will stop rendering the page. For modern browsers, CSP is the preferred method for mitigating XSS attacks.
